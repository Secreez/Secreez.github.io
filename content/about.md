## Who I Am

I'm [Max]imilian Elixhauser, finishing my Master's in Applied Geoinformatics at the University of Salzburg. I coordinate infrastructure and make sure workflows don't suck for the people who actually use them.

But that's the sanitized version. Here's the 'TL;DR' of the actual story:

## How I Got Here

Started working at 15, retail apprenticeship at 16. Offered a management track at 18—turned it down for university entrance exams instead. Did night school (BRP) while working, plus some years in municipal politics and union organizing. Needed a reset by 2021.

Started university in October 2021 at 23. First time in years I wasn't juggling multiple jobs and could actually pay for my own apartment. Took some adjusting.

Now I'm 27, finishing my Master's part-time, and I've found my lane: coordinating infrastructure so people can focus on their work instead of fighting with systems.

## Background (Or: How I Ended Up in Geoinformatics)

I'm not a geographer. At all.

My Bachelor's was in **Digitalization-Innovation-Society** (specialization: Geoinformatics). I came to spatial data from the infrastructure and coordination side, not from geography or earth sciences.

What interests me isn't maps or forests; it's making systems work for people: stakeholder management, workflow design, documentation that doesn't suck, infrastructure that's reliable enough to be boring. Geoinformatics happens to be a good domain for this because spatial data has interesting coordination challenges: multi-source integration, temporal alignment, international instructor teams, users across skill levels.

I ended up studying at Z_GIS because spatial data turned out to be complex enough to be interesting but structured enough to be manageable. Plus, staying in Salzburg made practical sense—I was already established here (work, apartment, network).

I'm a coordinator who happens to work with spatial data infrastructure, not a technical person who happens to coordinate.

This domain-agnostic approach is actually useful: I'm not emotionally attached to "how geographers do things." I just care about what works and enabling people.

## What I Actually Do

**Coordination & Stakeholder Management (60%):**
- Primary liaison between 15+ instructors (across countries) and publishing infrastructure
- Translate "I want X" into "here's what's feasible and why"
- Manage expectations, prevent scope creep, keep systems sustainable
- Weigh abstraction vs. complexity constantly
- Support users across skill levels and instructors when rewriting their books
- Make sure people can focus on content, not fight with tools

**Workflow Optimization (30%):**
- Design processes that are reproducible without heroic efforts
- Documentation for humans, not just reference material
- Training delivery (tutoring courses, conference presentations, one-on-one troubleshooting)
- Infrastructure that's boring and reliable => LTS Turtle approach
- "Can you rebuild this in 6 months?" quality control

**Technical Scripting (9.x%):**
- Write scripts (Lua, R, YAML, SCSS) to automate repetitive tasks so I don't have to do them manually
- Built the Quarto publishing system instructors use—but more importantly, I make sure it works for people who just want to teach
- Script the boring stuff so I can focus on the interesting problems
- Not building microservices or complex architectures at all. Just pragmatic tools that make my life easier (and help others with the right amount of abstraction)

**Research (0.x%):**
- Co-author on peer-reviewed publications ([COVID-19 mortality analysis](https://github.com/Secreez/air-connectivity-mortality), [ChatGPT in GIScience education](https://doi.org/10.1553/giscience2023_01_s140))
- Bachelor thesis: [Air Connectivity & COVID-19 Mortality](https://github.com/Secreez/air-connectivity-mortality) - reproducible pipeline
- Conference speaker (AGIT 2025: "Automatisierte Datenprozessierung mit R")
- But I'm not a researcher; I'm the ruthless audit who makes research reproducible and actually possible

**Philosophy:**
I'm a strong believer in "eating my own dog food" I build and use the systems I develop. If it breaks, I feel the pain first. Keeps you honest.

## Technical Stack

I use tools that reduce cognitive load and make workflows reproducible. Not optimizing for elegance—optimizing for "can someone else (or future-me) understand this in 6 months?"

**Daily Use:**
- **Git/GitHub** - Version control isn't optional. Not in Git = doesn't exist.
- **Quarto/RMarkdown** - Reproducible documents. Write once, output to multiple formats.
- **Documentation as infrastructure** - If you can't explain it, you don't understand it.

**When I Need Speed:**

- **R** - Declarative enough to reduce decision fatigue. I use tidyverse because opinionated design means less cognitive load. Use it every second day, not daily— let's be realistic.
- **Python** - When the ecosystem demands it. The [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) says "one obvious way," but then you have five libraries doing the same thing. I use it when needed, but R's declarative approach fits my brain better.
- **SQL** - Data lives in databases. Love SQL, but need it too seldom in my daily job. Keep sharp with hobbies: one day SQL quizzes, next day R challenges 20 minutes each morning. We're weird like that.
- **LaTeX, Markdown, YAML, ...** - The boring tools that actually work.

## What I Care About

- **Making Systems Work for People** - Complex tools should be usable by non-technical users. Coordination and communication matter more than technical perfection.
- **Reproducibility** - Research should be verifiable. Track data sources, document licenses, show workflows, make dependencies explicit. If someone else can't reproduce your results, it ain't science.
- **One-Command Rebuilds** - Not automation (I don't do cron jobs), but reproducible builds. `build.sh` should rebuild everything without manual steps. No "run script A, then manually do X, then run script B." That's a recipe for errors.
- **Sustainability** - Systems should be maintainable long-term without heroic efforts. The LTS Turtle approach: slow, steady, reliable. Boring technology that actually works.
- **Documentation as Love Letter** - To future you (and everyone else). If you can't show your work, why should anyone trust your conclusions?

**Political Training Turned Useful:**
Formal communication training (Renner Institut) + years in politics taught me:
- Explaining Git to researchers who just want to analyze data
- Writing documentation for multiple audiences
- Presenting at conferences without internal panic
- Navigating institutional politics
- Detecting bullshit with frightening accuracy

**Retail Taught Me:**
Process optimization, training people who don't want to be trained, working under pressure with incomplete information, and always having Plan B. Because without Plan B, you just have a wish.

## Work Philosophy

My work is like basslines: not flashy, knows its lane, but everything falls apart without it.

I'm an LTS Turtle. Slow, steady, reliable. No heroic efforts, no dramatic rewrites. Build it right, maintain it long-term, document so the next person (probably future-you) doesn't hate you and git-blame your commits.

Finishing my Master's in Applied Geoinformatics (Spatial Data Infrastructure specialization). I'm not here for flashy hypotheses or end products; I'm the person asking "but can you rebuild this in six months?" Infrastructure coordination, stakeholder management, workflow optimization. The boring stuff that makes research actually work.

## What's Next

Finishing my Master's in Applied Geoinformatics (Spatial Data Infrastructure specialization). Long-term trajectory: technical product management, infrastructure coordination, data governance, workflow optimization. I'm not here for flashy hypotheses or end products; I'm the person asking "but can you rebuild this in six months?" The boring stuff that makes research actually work.

## This Blog

This is my ePortfolio for the Applied Geoinformatics Master program. The assignment: maintain a blog, post once per semester.

I'll probably post when I build something worth documenting, solve an interesting workflow problem, or feel like yapping about reproducibility and infrastructure.

No categories. No posting schedule. Just whatever's worth writing down.
